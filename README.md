# Timed-Javascript-Quiz
This is an application using web APIs accessed with Javascript to run a quiz asking a player questions about Javascript. 

## How it should run 
When the "start" button is pressed :
* A card should appear with a Javascript trivia question
- a 60 second timer will start counting down
- if the question is answered correctly
  -  the next question will appear
- if the question is answered incorrectly
  - 10 seconds will be deducted from the time 
  - then the next question will appear
* If all the questions are answered within the given time limit
- user's time (score) will be display and user will be asked to 
  input their initials to be saved to the scoreboard
- when the user hits "submit-score" button
 - if their score falls in the range of the top 10 scores, their initials 
  and score will be displayed
* If time runs out before all questions are answered, user will be taken to a 
  "Time's Up" landing page where they can refresh the page to replay the game
